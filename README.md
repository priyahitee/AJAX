# AJAX

Have done a RESTFULL API request to display country data by using:
 1. Fetch API
 2. Promises
 3. Async/Await

Features:
1. Created getJSON Function for Reusable Requests:
    The getJSON function streamlines JSON data retrieval by encapsulating HTTP requests, enabling seamless URL-based access while adhering to the DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. This fosters code reuse, consistency, and scalability, enhancing overall maintainability.
   
2. Created RenderError function to handle error manually to display error gracefully:
   Implemented the renderError function to gracefully handle errors encountered during API requests, ensuring informative and user-friendly error messages are displayed. By centralizing error handling logic, the application delivers a polished and professional user experience, enhancing usability and user satisfaction.
